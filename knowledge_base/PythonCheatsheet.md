### Python Cheatsheet 

### Installation
We'll be using python

Python 3.10.xx

#### Installation
 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3105/

### Creating environments

#### venv
Typically we'll create virtual environments for our projects using venv
```
python3.10 -m venv venv
source ~/venv/venv/activate
```
This allows you to install things locally without interacting with the global space of the packages that you install

#### requirements.txt
It's useful to be able to just install a version of the packages used, we'll typically using requirements.txt to install necessary packages
```
# Generate a requirements.txt via pip freeze
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Types
Types are awesome, in the future cadcad, datascience aligned projects will use types, we'll try and use types as well
so a good primer here is
