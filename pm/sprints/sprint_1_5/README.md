### Readings
Chapter 3, 4.1 [Sayama] 

### Session Questions and answers
[Q&A cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr)

### Goals
 - Recap on what we talked aobut last week
 - Understand what a state variable is
 - Understand what phase space is


### Topic Discussion Suggestions
- Q&A
- How do we use phase space to understand a system 
- How do we visualize phase space, and what should we plot
- What is a state variable and how do they operate

### Practice (Group Exercise)
Can we create a visualization of the phase space of a [bonding curve](https://blog.relevant.community/bonding-curves-in-depth-intuition-parametrization-d3905a681e0a)

### Async Learning
How does the shape of our visualization change if there is a separate sell and buy curve?  


### Next Week
Next week we will be talking with an expert about interpeting model behavior. Jump ahead [here](../sprint_2_0/README.md)
