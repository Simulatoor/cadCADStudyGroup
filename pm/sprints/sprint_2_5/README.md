### Notes
# Sprint 2.5

### Readings
Chapter 4.2 - 4.6 [Sayama] , [Loop Diagrams](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/knowledge/causal-loop-diagram/what-is-causal-loop-diagram/)
[Stock and Flow Diagrams](https://thesystemsthinker.com/step-by-step-stocks-and-flows-improving-the-rigor-of-your-thinking/)

### Session Questions and answers
[Q&A cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr)

### Goals
 - Recap on what we talked aobut last week
 - Understand what how we get from model to equation to simulation 
 - Q & A
 - Discuss what we want to try and model going forward


### Topic Discussion Suggestions
- Q&A
- How do we go from second order to first order equation
- What are Causal Loop Diagrams
- What is the simulation framework we should use 

### Practice (Group Exercise)
2 for 1 token Model

#### Description
2 DAOs decided to merge and create a new token, they set the exchange rate for the new token to be 2 OG tokens for 1 YG token. Can we create a model for this exchange, that can simulate tokens being exchanged at a constant rate over time, until all the tokens are off the market. 

Plot the amount of tokens exchanged over time until there are no more tokens to exchange.

### Async Learning 
Bonus: Can you imagine that there is a time limit $t_{100}$. The introduction of a timelimit changes the dynamics of the system. This change shifts the time rate from being constant to exponential.

For example more exchanging happens at $t_{0}$ than at $t_{100}$ or vice versa.

Can you model this new exchange rate ? Can you calculate how many tokens did not get exchanged by the time limit $t_{100}$.


### Next Week
Next week we will be talking with an expert about going from diagram to equation. Jump ahead [here](../sprint_3_0/README.md)
